# How King of the Hills Work

To get started, you will need access to the types files for the loot and the profiles folder for the KOTH itself, inside of which you will find the different loadouts.  You can find both of these in this repo. Follows these instructions to update the loadouts for the KOTH:

01 Collect all the item names from the types files and put them into an open notepad doc.

02 Open the KOTH profile doc in a separate window or IDE app.

03 Replace the existing loot names with those you have collected in your list being sure to not change any of the formatting. ONLY replace the items name!

04 Save and you are done!

You can set up multiple loadouts, right now we have them as the following that will be selected at random:
- Building items
- Food and meds
- Hand guns
- Shotguns
- Assualt rifles
- Sniper rifles
Each has guns, the cooresponding mags and ammo included.

PLEASE KEEP IN MIND that there is limited space in the loot containers so it makes sense to use fewer items that are of higher value when making loadouts.
